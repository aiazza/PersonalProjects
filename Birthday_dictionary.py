# For this exercise, we will keep track of when our friendâ€™s birthdays are, 
# and be able to find that information based on their name. 
# Create a dictionary (in your file) of names and birthdays. 
 #When you run your program it should ask the user to enter a name, and return the birthday of that person back to them. 
# The interaction should look something like this:

#>>> Welcome to the birthday dictionary. We know the birthdays of:
#Albert Einstein
#Benjamin Franklin
#Ada Lovelace
#>>> Who's birthday do you want to look up?
#Benjamin Franklin
#>>> Benjamin Franklin's birthday is 01/17/1706.
